1) Add preferences for options
    - Night Mode
    - Difficulty
2) Finish sqlite for leaderboards
3) Add code so sound plays when animation runs
4) Clean up the UI a bit
    - Main menu title could be nicer
    - as could be the game type menu
        i) we could put the game type on the main menu to remove that fragment but its not that important
