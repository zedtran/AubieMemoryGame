1. Aubie's Memory Test

2. The app will take inspiration from the classic SIMON game. The app will initially present a customized splash screen. After a brief pause it will present a button that says start game. Once the game is started the player may select the difficulty after the difficulty is chosen four colored buttons (orange, blue, white, and green) and a score, originally set to zero, are shown on the screen. The app will choose a random sequence of colored buttons to flash. The user is tasked with hitting the correct sequence of colored buttons back. After each successful pass the length of buttons to be flashed is increased. The amount increased depends on the difficulty level selected. If the user hits the wrong colored button the game will end and the player will be prompted to enter a name so their score can be saved to the leaderboards, which is saved locally on the phone. The max length of the sequence is 30, but that is tentative to change.

3. Special instructions needed to build the app (if none, please indicate "none").

4. A list of known bugs:
	after being rotated animations do not play if reset is pressed
	after being rotated the screen is not updated correctly
	button animation goes while button press is not being registered
